# University Search App

A simple and beautiful university search page built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Axios**.

## 📋 Description

This project allows users to search for universities by name using the public API from [Hipolabs](http://universities.hipolabs.com/search). The results are paginated manually on the client side because the API does not support native pagination.
